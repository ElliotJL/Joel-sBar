This project is an iOS application built in Swift. It is designed for a Christian conference named Joel's Bar, giving information about the event. The main functionalities are the schedule (giving times and locations for each activity) and the FAQ's (answering common questions about the conference).

The application is not quite complete, as the data for the schedule, FAQ's etc. needs to be finalised before being added. For now, it is filled with example text, but will be replaced once the data is definite.
